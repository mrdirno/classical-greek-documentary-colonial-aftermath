## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a modern tourist's photo accidentally captures a spectral figure in the ruins, visible only later on their phone screen, and they become obsessed with returning to the site.
- Create a monologue from the perspective of the fallen Nike statue, describing the centuries of occupation, plunder, and neglect she has witnessed from her vantage point in the dust.
- Imagine a short story about Sophia's grandfather, the water-carrier for the German archaeologists, focusing on a single small artifact he secretly pockets and the guilt/connection it creates for his descendants.
- Write a 'found document'—a page from Professor Rallis's sketchbook, containing not just a drawing of a ruin, but his furious, scribbled marginalia about what he sees and what it means.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of a fictional archaeological site like Eleusis, where users can click on different ruins (Temple, Telesterion, Sacred Way) to reveal layered historical annotations—Classical, Venetian, Ottoman, Modern—visualizing the 'colonial aftermath'.
- Create a generative text tool that mimics Rallis's voice: input a description of a modern object or scene, and it outputs a cynical, historically-laden critique in the style of the Professor's diatribes.

## Origin

Generated through persona500's Council-Prism Generation.
SASI evaluation: 8/10

Council: W.G. Sebald (for the melancholic archaeology of memory and ruin), Maggie Nelson (for the blending of critical theory with intimate, visceral prose), Derek Walcott (for the post-colonial perspective on classical tradition and landscape), Anna Akhmatova (for the theme of bearing witness to historical erasure under pressure)
